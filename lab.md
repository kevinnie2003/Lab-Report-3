# Lab Report 3

## Grep Command

For this lab report, I have chosen the `grep` command. The `grep` command is a powerful tool for searching and filtering text. It allows you to find specific patterns in text files and display the lines containing those patterns. I have found four interesting command-line options for `grep` and provided two examples for each option using files and directories from `./written_2`.

### 1. -i (ignore case)

The `-i` option allows you to perform a case-insensitive search. This is helpful when you want to find a pattern regardless of the text's capitalization.

**Example 1:**

```bash
$ grep -i 'pattern' ./written_2/example1.txt
